This booking system is mainly written by Python.

The purpose of this system is try to simplified the process of booking tickets on 

the offical website of Taiwanese Railway Administration.



By double click the batch script "starter.bat", 

you should see there is a cmd terminal window display on your device(Windows).

At the same time, the batch scripts would open your browser(Chrome) then get into the interface of booking system automatically.



If your device don't have chrome or the IP Address is not working, you could switch to the cmd(Command Line) window, the window 

should display the running server's IP Address.

Just copy the running server's IP Address then open your own browser, past the IP Address to your browser.

Now you should see the interface of booking system.
